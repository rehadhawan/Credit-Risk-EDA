# Credit-Risk-EDA

Welcome to the Credit Risk Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! In this project, we perform an in-depth analysis of a credit risk dataset to gain insights into the data and understand the factors that contribute to credit risk. This README provides an overview of the project, its contents, and how to use the provided code and resources.


## Introduction

Credit risk assessment is crucial in the financial industry to determine the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. This project aims to perform an EDA on a credit risk dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and potential insights that can assist in building predictive models for credit risk assessment.

## Dataset

The credit risk dataset used in this project contains information about various loan applicants, including their financial attributes, employment history, housing type and loan outcomes. The dataset is available in CSV format.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

The notebook `credit risk dataset.ipynb` contains the step-by-step analysis of the credit risk dataset. The analysis covers:

- Data loading and basic statistics
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Visualization of key features
- Identification of potential correlations

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-risk-eda.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```cd credit-risk-eda```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `notebooks/EDA.ipynb` to see the detailed EDA process and findings.


### Feel free to reach out or contribute to the project. Happy analyzing!
